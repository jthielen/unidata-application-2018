Unidata Summer Internship Application Source Code Sample
========================================================

**Jon Thielen ([@jthielen](https://github.com/jthielen))**

If you are a reviewer for the application, I want to say thank you for considering my application! In this repository, you will find two documents of note:

- [An Overview of my MetPy contributions](metpy_contributions.md)
- [Waves Project Notebook](waves_project.ipynb)

The first document is up-to-date as of the time of my application (for the most up-to-date list of my PR's, [this query](https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ajthielen) should get you what you need). The second document is a notebook in which I took a collection of scripts developed from a past class project, cleaned them up for presentation in a demonstration notebook, and modified them to take advantage of xarray.

If you are not a reviewer, but are interested in any of the contents of this repo, please feel free to [contact me](https://github.com/jthielen) with any questions!
