Unidata Summer Internship Application Source Code Sample
========================================================

**Jon Thielen (@jthielen)**

*Currently a Work In Progress!*

If you are a reviewer for the application, I want to say thank you for considering my application! In this repository, you will find two documents of note:

- [An Overview of my MetPy contributions](metpy_contributions.md)
- [Synoptic Meteorology Examples Notebook](synoptic_examples.ipynb)

The first document is up-to-date as of the time of my application (for the most up-to-date list of my PR's, [this query](https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ajthielen) should get you what you need). The second document was assembled for this application from a few different rough examples I had done in the past, and some new content, to make a more complete sample.

If you are not a reviewer, but are interested in any of the contents of this repo, please feel free to [contact me](https://github.com/jthielen) with any questions!
